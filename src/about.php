    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jesse Smick. I have lived my whole life in the East Bay Area moving around between a few cities.</p>
    <p>I took a computer programming class in middle school and have enjoyed programming ever since. I started out with very simple web pages using vertical <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags everywhere.</p>
    <p>I went to Diablo Valley College after high school. I am currently a transfer student to San Francisco State University.</p>
    <p>I am taking CSC 412 in the Fall of 2017.</p>
